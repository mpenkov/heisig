This is a collection of scripts for helping my study Japanese and procrastinate.

The notebooks are centered on a [talk](https://git.io/mpenkov/talks/pyjp18.html) I gave in PyCon JP 2018.

The demo subdirectory contains a CherryPy application for drawing interactive graphs with Kanji.
I've also extended it to do Kanji lookups based on the material in the talk.
